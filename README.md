A tutorial on learning Makefiles (Based on tutorial written [here](http://www.cs.colby.edu/maxwell/courses/tutorials/maketutor/))

The ultimate `make` and Makefile resource: [GNU make docs](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html)

### What is a makefile?

A makefile is a special file that lists a set of rules for compiling a project.
These rules are called *targets*.  When you call the program `make`, it runs through each of these targets in your Makefile and executes them.


### What is the syntax of a Makefile?

Makefiles incorporate bash scripting with its own special syntax to indicate targets and variables.

You can run bash commands like

```
all:
    echo Hello
```

Makefiles also have special macros for indicating variables:


`CC`          --> Tells `make` which C compiler to use

`CFLAGS`      --> Specifies command line flags to pass to compiler

`DEPS`        --> File dependencies



You can also introduce your own macros like:

`TARGETS`     --> Indicates a list of targets to build
